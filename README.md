3. Take all the attack-based data and use it to create a Pivot Table
   Separate Data by Pokemon type and Pokemon Generation
   Find the Average attack points of each Pokemon type
4. Create a Filter to remove non-legendary Pokemon data from the Pivot Table
5. Use pivot table data to create a graph
   Each bar represents the average attack points of each Pokemon type separated by each generation
6. Find Pokemon, Generation, and Pokemon type Pokemon with the highest and lowest Attack Points
7. Find Pokemon, Generation, and Pokemon type of Pokemon with the highest and lowest Attack Points from Pokemon belonging to the Second generation
8. Find Pokemon, Generation, and Pokemon type of Pokemon with the highest and lowest Defence Points
